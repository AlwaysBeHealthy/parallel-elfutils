---------------
cilk-parse test
---------------

This test is a proxy for hpcstruct with cilk threads.  It iterates
through the same hierarchy of functions, loops, blocks, instructions,
inline call sequences and line map info, and makes the same queries
that hpcstruct would make.

This program tests that we can make parallel queries to ParseAPI and
SymtabAPI.  For now, we parse the entire binary sequentially and then
use cilk_for to analyze the functions in parallel.

Build the cilk-parse test with the '-fcilkplus' option.  Be sure the
C++ compiler supports cilk, for example, gnu g++ 5.x or later.

./mk-dyninst.sh -fcilkplus cilk-parse.cpp /externals/dir

Run the test with two arguments: the binary file to analyze and
(optionally) the number of threads.  

./cilk-plus filename [num-threads]

If num-threads is not specified, the program will try the
CILK_NWORKERS environment variable.
